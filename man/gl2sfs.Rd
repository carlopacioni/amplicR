\item{gl}{the genlight object}

\item{outfile_root}{The root of the name of the output file}

\description{
The output of this function is suitable for analysis in fastsimcoal2 or dada.
}
\details{
It saves a derived sfs, assuming that the reference allele is the ancestral,
and a MAF sfs.

At this stage this function caters only for diploid organisms, for samples
from one population only, and for genotypes without missing data.

It expects a dartR formatted genlight object, but will work with other gl as
long as the have a \code{data.frame} in \code{other} called loc.metrics with
a column named \code{TrimmedSequence} that contains a character string whose
length corrensponds to the number of sites of the allele. This information is
used to obtained the number of non-polymorphic sites.

TO-DO: deal with missing data. See
